On Discord you will have to use `/configuration` to create a configuration message that will be used to store your configurations.

Context menu :
1. Right click on the message
2. Hover over "Apps"
3. Select "Create agent" or "Create knowledge base"
   - "Create knowledge base" will create a new knowledge base from the messages and the attachments of the message you clicked on.
   - "Create agent" will create a new agent from the aknowledgment message of knowledge base creation automaticaly sent by the bot after the creation of the knowledge base

Commands :
1. /link
   - This command will link the channel to the agent you want to use.
2. /unlink
   - This command will unlink the channel from the agent.
3. /delete
   - This command will delete either an agent or a knowledge base.
